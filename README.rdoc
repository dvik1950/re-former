== re-former


A simple rails app created by following the partial instructions given on The Odin Project.
You can create new users, edit them and see single users from the database.

Thoughts:

Forms were a lot more difficult to do than I thought. While making this simple app I learnt how to create simple forms using regular html and rails' form_tag and form_for methods.
